Welcome to the Battery Sizing Model's Documentation
===================================================
**battery_sizing_model** is a Python module for simulating a microgrid level lithium-ion battery pack.
The package currently only supports NCA chemistry batteries but the intention is to add more in
the future. The documentation describes how to install the package, run a simulation,
and documentation for the code. For more information on how the project was developed,
data was processed, and the reasoning behind design decisions checkout the 
`repository <https://github.com/seanbuchanan-eng/battery_sizing_model>`_
and the pdf report there.

To get started see the :doc:`installation` and :doc:`usage` sections of the docs.
